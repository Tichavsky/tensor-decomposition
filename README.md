# tensor-decomposition
Krylov-Levenberg-Marquardt method for CP tensor decomposition

There are several variants of the codes: versions for order-3 tensors, order-4 tensors, versions for CP decomposition with limited sensitivity, and version for weighted CP decomposition. The code is independent of any other tensor toolboxes. If used, please cite the paper
